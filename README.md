# Softy Pinko Progress

In here I just keep tabs on myself (don't really fancy the projects tab) and hopefully motivate through example!

# 13/10/2019 Update
  ### Kind of abandoned the project for 2 months, transfering schools, "moving" to a different country, life stuff. I'm hoping to pick this up, but not just as a html/css project, but rather a full fledged project where I'll learn es6 and maybe spice everything up with some sexy php and databases.


## Html

22/08/19
  - *Got to testimonials with markup, should probably finish the crash course before continuing. Better ways to do what I'm trying to,    specifically focus on dropdown navbar.*

23/08/19
  - *No progress today at all, not really feeling like coding atm, will definitely catch up tomorrow!

## Css

22/08/19
  - *No progress on css at all, waiting on markup.*

23/08/19
  - *Same as Html.*
