# Softy Pinko Progress

In here I just keep tabs on myself (don't really fancy the projects tab) and hopefully motivate through example!

## Html

22/08/19
  - *Got to testimonials with markup, should probably finish the crash course before continuing. Better ways to do what I'm trying to,    specifically focus on dropdown navbar.*

23/08/19
  - *No progress today at all, not really feeling like coding atm, will definitely catch up tomorrow!

## Css

22/08/19
  - *No progress on css at all, waiting on markup.*

23/08/19
  - *Same as Html.*
