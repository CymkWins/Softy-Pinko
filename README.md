# Softy Pinko Progress

# Html
Got to testimonials with markup, should probably finish the crash course before continuing. Better ways to do what I'm trying to, specifically focus on dropdown navbar.

# Css
No progress on css at all, waiting on markup.

# Javascript
Probably not gonna implement just yet, should focus only on mastering bootstrap and transition to javascript after.
